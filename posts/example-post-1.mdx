introducing chess to a child, understanding the fundamentals is the first
step toward mastery.

This guide explains core chess concepts in a simple and structured way,

# Why Learn Chess?

Chess improves concentration, memory, and problem-solving skills. It teaches
players to plan ahead, evaluate consequences, and remain calm under pressure.
These skills extend beyond the chessboard into academics and everyday life.

## Core Objectives of Chess

The primary goal of chess is to checkmate your opponent’s king. However,
successful players focus on several sub-goals along the way.

### Key Objectives
- Control the center of the board  
- Develop pieces efficiently  
- Protect the king  
- Create threats while defending weaknesses  

#### Long-Term Thinking
Strong chess players think several moves ahead and consider both attack and
defense before committing to a plan.

## Essential Chess Principles

### Opening Principles

- Avoid moving the same piece repeatedly  

### Middlegame Concepts

- Create plans based on the position  
- Coordinate pieces for attack and defense  

### Endgame Basics

## Common Beginner Mistakes
